Online chess game example project.

Roadmap:
*Functioning chess game.
*Functioning PvP feature.
*Integrating Stockfish for PvE.

The chess pieces are created by Wikipedia user Cburnett as they are found here: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:SVG_chess_pieces - they are under the creative commons licence.

The appearance has been slightly altered to fit my project needs.

If this is a problem, please contact me at any time.
